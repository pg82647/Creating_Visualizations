Creating Visualizations using Power BI


There are two (2) assignment files; PowerBI_Week9_EtebomNtuk.pbix and PowerBI_Week9_EtebomNtuk_CF.pbix files.  
The first file shows how to apply bins and lists to visualizations on the first page, and some popular visualizations on the second page.  
The second file shows how conditional formatting can be applied to visualizations.
